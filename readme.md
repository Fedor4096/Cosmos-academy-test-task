# Project description

This project is a test task for obtaining developer certification in the Cosmos ecosystem.

This project is dedicated to the future payments of [toll roads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll_road). The project, built with Ignite 0.22.1 and CosmJS 0.28.13.

The project implements the functionality of:

1. **Adding new toll road operators.**
   Operators own part of the toll road and make a profit for its use. Operators make a profit from each user of the toll road.

2. **Depositing payment for travel in various tokens by users and making final transactions.**
   The idea is that at the beginning of the toll road, the user deposits his tokens to the account of the selected operator. And at the end of the user's trip, the operator can finally get full access to
   tokens on his account.
